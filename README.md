# Two-view-sparse-reconstruction

- Reconstructed the scene being captured from a calibrated monocular camera.

- Reconstructed a sparse set of points in the scene using only two views (images of the
same scene taken from different locations).

- Also reconstructed a synthetic cube (made up of 56 points) using multi-view triangulation. Multi-view triangulation is a straight forward extension of 2-view triangulation.

- Run the sparseReconstruction.m file to get the reconstructed scene. (images are uploaded for reference)

### Multi view reconstruction

- Open the cube_imgs.mat and projMatrices.mat files in Matlab before running the main_recon.m file to get the reconstructed 56 point cube.
